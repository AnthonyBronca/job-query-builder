This is a query generator for job seekers!

Google and Linkedin have specific syntaxes for boolean searches, and this is an easy to have a program build all that syntax for you!

How to use:

Step 1: Install the repo
step 1 and a half: Open your terminal and use 'cd' to cd to this repo directory (this is for those non-tech people)
Step 2: run the following command in the terminal

```
python3 query-generator.py
```

This will begin the prompts.

It will ask you if you want to add a specific part of the search, or omit that part entirely. You can then type 'y' or 'n' and submit by pressing enter.

Some prompts will give suggestions for sites to include in your search, or keywords to include/omit from a search

after all questions are complete, the terminal will spit out your Google boolean search! Copy and paste it into Google and then happy job applying!

Some notes:

- I am still working on the LinkedIn portion of the query generator

- I plan to add a very simple front-end site one day to help make it usable by non-tech people
