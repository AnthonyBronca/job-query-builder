Google and Linkedin have specific syntaxes for boolean searches, and this is an easy to have a program build all that syntax for you!

How to use:

Step 1: Fill out the forms using only comma seperated terms. Example: google.com,linkedin.com  
step 2: Press the button at the bottom
Step 3: Copy the result, go to google.com, paste, and enoy!

Happy job applying!

Some notes:

- I am still working on the LinkedIn portion of the query generator
